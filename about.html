						<h2>Biography</h2>
						<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/HeadshotH" alt="" /></a>
						<p>Well hello! Time for my life story I guess.</p>
						<p>My name is Ciara Judge and I am an Irish researcher and science communicator.
						</p>
						<p>In early 2015 I cofounded my first company, Germinaid Innovations with my friend Emer Hickey. The company gained traction over the following two years which resulted in a year long partnership with Bill Gates’ Intellectual Ventures in Seattle during the 2016/17 academic year. I also cofounded a second startup PurchaseMate, an app that aimed to make socially responsible shopping more accessible by providing brand CSR information through scanning the barcode of a product in store. During my teens, I spent many summers at MIT in Boston: in 2015 to attend the entrepreneurship incubator MIT Launch, and returning the following two years as staff. In 2019 I rejoined the program to act as Education and Training Coordinator across the three locations of MIT, University of Michigan, and Northwestern University. I have since stepped away from such pursuits to focus on furthering my career in academic research.
						</p>
						<p>In addition to my background in the technology and entrepreneurship sector, I am also passionate about science and youth activism, and in 2016 was named a Global Teen Leader by the We Are Family Foundation for my efforts in the fight against world hunger. I have continued to work closely with the We Are Family Foundation since 2016 and have spoken at many of their conferences and events, most notably when I delivered a talk at TedxTeen in London in 2016. I am also coauthor of the Bratislava Declaration of Young Researchers, issued under the Slovak EU Presidency. In November 2016 I was named by JCI as being among the ten most Outstanding Young People in the World and was honoured at their world congress in Quebec.</p>
						<p>In 2020 I graduated from University College Cork, where I was awarded a Quercus Scholarship for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, with a BSc in Genetics. I then went on to complete an MPhil in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge. For my thesis I worked with the Goldman Lab at the European Bioinformatics Institute to develop a pipeline for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, in an effort to further the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
						<p> In a natural next step, I have just commenced my PhD in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine under the supervision of Associate Professor Oli Brady, Dr Sarah Hill, and Professor Oliver Pybus. Specifically, I aim to develop tools for arbovirus outbreak response, combining the fields of epidemiology and phylogenetics.</p>
						<p>I am a strong believer in the ethos that young people are just as able, if not more able to change the world as adults, and I try to spread this message by speaking at events and conferences worldwide. Some notable people in my audiences have included President Jimmy Carter, Bono, President Micheal D Higgins, Tim Cook, and Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP Worldwide.</p>

								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/HeadshotH" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Well hello! Time for my life story I guess.</p>
								<p>My name is Ciara Judge and I am an Irish science communicator, scientist and (kinda) entrepreneur. As a young teenager I was part of a team that won the BT Young Scientist, the EU Young Scientist and the Google Science Fair for research into natural bacteria based approaches to increasing crop productivity. In 2014 TIME Magazine named me as being one of the 25 most influential teens worldwide.
								</p>
								<p>In early 2015 I cofounded my first company, Germinaid Innovations with my friend Emer Hickey. The company gained traction over the following two years which resulted in a year long partnership with Bill Gates’ Intellectual Ventures in Seattle during the 2016/17 academic year. I also cofounded a second startup PurchaseMate, an app that aimed to make socially responsible shopping more accessible by providing brand CSR information through scanning the barcode of a product in store. During my teens, I spent many summers at MIT in Boston: in 2015 to attend the entrepreneurship incubator MIT Launch, and returning the following two years as staff. In 2019 I rejoined the program to act as Education and Training Coordinator across the three locations of MIT, University of Michigan, and Northwestern University. I have since stepped away from such pursuits to focus on furthering my career in academic research.
								</p>
								<p>In addition to my background in the technology and entrepreneurship sector, I am also passionate about science and youth activism, and in 2016 was named a Global Teen Leader by the We Are Family Foundation for my efforts in the fight against world hunger. I have continued to work closely with the We Are Family Foundation since 2016 and have spoken at many of their conferences and events, most notably when I delivered a talk at TedxTeen in London in 2016. I am also coauthor of the Bratislava Declaration of Young Researchers, issued under the Slovak EU Presidency. In November 2016 I was named by JCI as being among the ten most Outstanding Young People in the World and was honoured at their world congress in Quebec.</p>
								<p>In 2020 I graduated from University College Cork, where I was awarded a Quercus Scholarship for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, with a BSc in Genetics. I then went on to complete an MPhil in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge. For my thesis I worked with the Goldman Lab at the European Bioinformatics Institute to develop a pipeline for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, in an effort to further the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
								<p> In a natural next step, I have just commenced my PhD in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine under the supervision of Associate Professor Oli Brady, Dr Sarah Hill, and Professor Oliver Pybus. Specifically, I aim to develop tools for arbovirus outbreak response, combining the fields of epidemiology and phylogenetics.</p>
								<p>I am a strong believer in the ethos that young people are just as able, if not more able to change the world as adults, and I try to spread this message by speaking at events and conferences worldwide. Some notable people in my audiences have included President Jimmy Carter, Bono, President Micheal D Higgins, Tim Cook, and Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP Worldwide.</p>
