						<h2>Biography</h2>
						<p> Ciara is a PhD candidate in infectious disease modelling at the London School
							of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She works on new methods of tracking and mapping
							outbreaks that use both epidemiological and genetic concepts and data. During the COVID-19
							pandemic, Ciara worked with the European Bioinformatics Institute and Cambridge Department
							of Chemistry to build a pipeline for modeling SARS-CoV-2 evolution that helped design
							variant-robust antibody treatments. She has a BSc in Genetics from University College Cork
							and is a past winner of the Google Global Science Fair, the European Union Contest for Young
							Scientists and the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. Ciara is very passionate about
							science communication and youth outreach, and has addressed audiences worldwide about her
							research - most recently attending the United Nations General Assembly last September to
							attend high level meetings on pandemic preparedness and public health.
